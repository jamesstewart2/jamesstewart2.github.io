<p>VoIP phone service has actually been around for a long time as services and entrepreneurs change from telephone services that utilize PSTN (Public Changed Telephone Network) to a more advanced system. There is a substantial variety of VoIP providers on the internet which supply SIP trunking (telephony services) for less expensive call rates than conventional telephony providers. The software and hardware is affordable, too, for VoIP phone systems.
