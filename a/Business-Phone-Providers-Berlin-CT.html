<p>VoIP phone service has actually been around for a long time as services and entrepreneurs change from telephone services that utilize PSTN (Public Changed Telephone Network) to a more advanced system. There is a substantial variety of VoIP providers on the internet which supply SIP trunking (telephony services) for less expensive call rates than conventional telephony providers. The software and hardware is affordable, too, for VoIP phone systems. In addition, cordless "hot spots" in locations such as parks, cafes, and airports permit you to link to the Internet and might enable you to use VoIP service wirelessly.</p>
<p>The key difference between PBX and VoIP is that in the event of a power outage, and no internet, a PBX phone system normally has an uninterruptible power supply, and utilizes the public switched telephone network (PSTN). From small company VoIP providers to enterprise VoIP phone systems, every business phone service has a different list of function sets, and rates. Calls in between VoIP and the analogue network are made possible by devices (such as Media Gateways) creating connections between them.</p>
