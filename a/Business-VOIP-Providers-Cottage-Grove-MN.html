<p>. A feature-rich VoIP phone system for small business. Consumers of Nextiva's small company VoIP phone service usually experience savings of as much as 60% on their regular monthly phone costs. Above all, VoIP is hosted on the cloud which can be quickly upgraded over-the-air with bug fixes and enhancements.
